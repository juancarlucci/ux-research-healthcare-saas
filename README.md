# AcuBliss Learning Design Project

> **A structured approach to Learning Design and Developer Experience (DevEx) research for AcuBliss patient portal and practitioner onboarding.**

---

## Project Overview

This repository documents my work improving the learning and onboarding experience for AcuBliss, a practice management platform for acupuncturists and holistic healthcare practitioners.

**Role:** Learning Designer / Developer Experience Researcher  
**Timeline:** January 2025 - Ongoing  
**Focus Areas:** Patient portal booking flows, practitioner onboarding

---

## What This Project Does

I'm observing how AcuBliss teaches itself to users, identifying where understanding breaks down, and translating findings into actionable product improvements.

**Key activities:**
- Structured user observation (patient and practitioner flows)
- Pattern synthesis across multiple sessions
- Learning-oriented feedback (not UI nitpicking)
- Bridging user experience → product decisions → engineering

## Methodology

I use a **5-part observation framework** to keep feedback at the product/business level:

1. **Context** — Where is the user in their journey?
2. **Expectation** — What mental model does the UI imply?
3. **Reality** — What actually happened?
4. **Impact** — Why does this matter for adoption/trust/retention?
5. **Opportunity** — What's the learning design opportunity (not UI prescription)?

This framework prevents:
- UI nitpicking
- Feature requests without rationale
- Bug reports disguised as insights

This framework promotes:
- Business-level framing
- Mental model analysis
- Confidence and trust tracking
- Actionable, groomable feedback

## Current Status

**Phase:** Patient Portal - Initial Observations  
**Completed:**
- ✅ First-time patient booking pass
- ✅ Pattern identification (3 emerging patterns)

**In Progress:**
- Patient variation passes (different flows, practitioners)
- Practitioner onboarding observation (upcoming)

**Next:**
- Synthesis for Linear issues
- High-impact opportunities document

---

## Key Findings (So Far)

Early patterns emerging from initial observation:

1. **Practitioner Assignment Clarity** — Highest-impact friction point  
   Users unsure "who am I booking with?" at critical trust moment
   
2. **System State Visibility** — Moderate impact  
   Users ask "am I done? what's next?" more often than optimal
   
3. **Entry Point Guidance** — Low confidence, needs validation  
   Initial flow start may benefit from clearer orientation

See [`synthesis/patterns.md`](synthesis/patterns.md) for full analysis.

## How This Work Supports AcuBliss

**Immediate value:**
- Patient portal improvements based on real user friction
- Structured feedback ready for Linear issue creation
- Business-level framing (adoption, trust, retention)

**Long-term value:**
- Reusable methodology for future features
- Onboarding documentation improvements
- Mental model clarity for practitioner setup

## About This Approach

This project demonstrates a **Learning Design / Developer Experience** approach to product improvement:

- Observation before prescription
- Mental models before mockups
- Patterns before pixel-pushing
- Business impact before aesthetics

This methodology is transferable to any product, platform, or documentation challenge.
