# Learning Design / Developer Experience Role Definition

## Context
This document defines my role and approach for HealthFlow, as Learning Design / Developer Relations engineer.

## Role Overview
I'm working at the intersection of **Learning Design**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, and **systems thinking** to improve how HealthFlow teaches itself to both practitioners and patients.

## What I Do

### Core Responsibilities
- **Observe learning journeys**: Experience the product as a first-time user (patient, practitioner)
- **Identify friction points**: Where does understanding break down? Where does confidence decrease?
- **Translate to mental models**: What mental models does the system imply vs. actually support?
- **Frame opportunities**: Not prescribing UI, but identifying where learning design can help
- **Create actionable feedback**: Bridge user experience → product decisions → engineering

### Key Questions I'm Answering
1. How does HealthFlow teach itself?
2. Where do users gain or lose confidence?
3. What's the difference between *functional* and *learnable*?
4. How can onboarding reduce friction without adding complexity?

## Approach

### Methodology
1. **Embodied observation**: Experience flows as a real user would
2. **Structured capture**: Use the 5-part framework (Context → Expectation → Reality → Impact → Opportunity)
3. **Pattern synthesis**: Group observations into themes
4. **Outcome-oriented translation**: Connect insights to business value (adoption, retention, trust)

### What I Explicitly Avoid
- Prescribing visual design
- Listing UI nitpicks
- Solving technical architecture
- Feature requests without learning rationale

## Value Proposition

### For HealthFlow
- Improve patient portal onboarding
- Reduce practitioner setup friction
- Increase confidence at critical moments
- Support better documentation as learning experience
- Inform product decisions with learning research

### For Me
- Build portfolio evidence of LD/DevEx work
- Practice observation → synthesis → communication
- Demonstrate bridge role between users, product, and engineering
- Create reusable templates and methodology

## Alignment with Team

### What GQ Asked For
"Test it out as a practice patient... we're revamping the patient portal and could use some feedback... organize a Linear issue with it all."

### What JL Asked For
"Use HealthFlow como si fueras un usuario real... tu mirada fresca y tu experiencia en frontend/UX para detectar cosas que a nosotros ya se nos pasan."

### What I'm Delivering
Structured, learning-oriented feedback that:
- Surfaces patterns, not isolated bugs
- Frames impact at the business level
- Respects their product velocity
- Translates cleanly to Linear issues
