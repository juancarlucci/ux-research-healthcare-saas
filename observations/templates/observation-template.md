# Observation Template

Use this template for structured observations. This is the **5-part framework** that keeps feedback at the learning/product level, not UI nitpicking level.

## Flow/Area: [e.g., "Account Creation & First Login"]

### 1. Context (Where am I?)
What step/flow/mindset is the user in?

**Example:**  
"As a first-time clinic owner creating an account..."

**Your observation:**


---

### 2. Expectation (What I thought would happen)
What mental model does the UI imply?

**Example:**  
"I expected to clearly understand what the next step was and why it mattered."

**Your observation:**


---

### 3. Reality (What actually happened)
What did the product actually do?

**Example:**  
"I wasn't sure if the practice was fully set up or if something was missing."

**Your observation:**


---

### 4. Impact (Why this matters)
Connect to business value: adoption, confidence, trust, retention.

**Example:**  
"This creates uncertainty at a moment where the user needs confidence to continue. It may increase drop-off during onboarding."

**Your observation:**


---

### 5. Opportunity (Not a solution, a direction)
Suggest learning intent, not UI prescription.

**Example:**  
"This might be an opportunity to make the system's state more explicit—e.g., what's complete, what's optional, and what's next."

**Your observation:**

## Quick Reference

**DO focus on:**
- Confusion, uncertainty, cognitive overload
- Missing explanations or unclear system state
- Broken mental models
- Moments of hesitation or lost confidence
- Trust erosion

**DON'T comment on:**
- Visual design preferences (colors, spacing)
- Performance (unless it blocks understanding)
- Backend architecture
- Edge cases
- Feature completeness
- "I would redesign this..."

**Remember:** If you felt it, it matters. If it's aesthetic, it can wait.
