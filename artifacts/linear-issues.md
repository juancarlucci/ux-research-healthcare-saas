## Active Issues

### DYN-13825: Patient Portal — Hidden vs. Guided Booking Paths Create Practitioner Assignment Confusion

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Awaiting Review  
**Created:** January 6, 2025

**Summary:**  
Critical finding — the booking portal has two completely different entry paths (guided vs. direct practitioner selection), but only one is explained. The higher-confidence path (direct selection) is hidden, leaving patients uncertain about "who am I seeing?" throughout the booking flow.

### DYN-13826: Patient Portal — "Complete Your Forms" Requirement Not Enforced, Creates Ambiguity

**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Awaiting Review  
**Created:** January 6, 2025

**Summary:**  
The patient portal displays "You need to complete forms" but doesn't enforce this requirement. Patients can book additional appointments without completing forms, creating confusion about what's actually required vs. recommended.

### DYN-13827: Patient Portal — That First Moment — Where Do I Actually Start?

**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Awaiting Review  
**Created:** January 6, 2025

**Summary:**  
First-time patients experience slight visual density and competing entry points on the landing page. Multiple elements compete for attention, creating mild cognitive load before the first action. Medium-confidence pattern that may benefit from testing before prioritization.
